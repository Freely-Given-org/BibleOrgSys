# Enclosed are four files:
#
#   DataFiles/BibleBooksCodes.xml
#       A UTF-8 XML file encoding SBL, OSIS, USFM/OXES/UBS-Paratext, CCEL, NETBible, and Sword Bible books codes
#           The data also includes a new 3-letter UPPER CASE referenceAbbreviation which always starts with a letter and so can be used directly as an XML ID (unlike most of the other fields).
#               These referenceAbbreviation fields are often put in a variable called BBB (BiBle Book 3-character code) in program code.
#           The unique 1..255 referenceNumber values are for processing and error messages -- numbers 1..66 are guaranteed to match the normal Protestant Bible.
#           The English name is included as a comment only and is unimportant (although it might be used for some crude processing purposes).
#           See the comments at the beginning of the file itself for the most up-to-date information on the file contents.
#       The file also includes an internal DTD. To validate the XML on Linux systems, use
#           xmllint --noout --valid DataFiles/BibleBooksCodes.xml
#               (If it gives no output or error messages, then it has validated.)
#       The file includes an OSIS style header record. (See PDF file at http://bibletechnologies.net)
#           Note though, that we use the xsd:date style with hyphens not with periods as per OSIS.
#           Note also that you might have to expand the internal DTD and the Relax NG schema if you add additional fields to the header.
#       The data comes from the SBL Manual of Style, the OSIS 2.1.1 users' manual and from the VERY HELPFUL http://lc.bfbs.org.uk/request.php?canonicalissuesinparatext.pdf.
#       While it is a derived work, I don't expect anyone to object to the use of this data. I think it is fair use to offer it as a public domain compilation.
#
#   DataFiles/BibleBooksCodes.rnc
#       A RelaxNG Compact Syntax schema file
#       On Linux, to convert to RNG, use
#           trang DataFiles/BibleBooksCodes.rnc DerivedFiles/BibleBooksCodes.rng
#       On Linux, to validate against the .rng file, use
#           xmllint --noout --relaxng DerivedFiles/BibleBooksCodes.rng DataFiles/BibleBooksCodes.xml
#       or better still, to validate against both this and the internal DTD, use
#           xmllint --noout --relaxng DerivedFiles/BibleBooksCodes.rng --valid DataFiles/BibleBooksCodes.xml
#
#   BibleBooksCodes.py (for Python 3)
#       This small program will load and do some very basic checking of the XML data file.
#           It contains two classes -- the Converter class is not intended to be used by most end-user programs.
#       It can be used in a larger Python program to load the XML data into a number of Python dictionaries (with different fields as the key).
#       It can also be used to convert and export the XML data directly to Python or C code which can be included in another program as well as JSON format
#           (if you don't want to have to supply or validate the master XML file).
#       It is expected that the user might want to modify the Python code in order to customize it to your particular needs for either of the above strategies.
#       The program is open source with a GPL-3.0 licence.
#       If you have Python3 installed on Linux, run the program with ./BibleBooksCodes.py --help (once you have made the program file "executable").
#               (Alternatively, try: python3 BibleBooksCodes.py --help)
#       To export the data in other formats, use --export (instead of --help).
#           This should load and check the XML file and create BibleBooksCodes_Tables.* files in the DerivedFiles folder, suitable for including in other programs.
#       If the program is run without any additional parameters, it runs in a demo mode which should show the use of some of the available routines.
#
#   Tests/BibleBooksCodesTests.py (for Python 3)
#       Running this program from the command line will automatically run tests on the above module, listing tests which fail.
#           A result of OK indicates that the tests have all passed.
#       If you have Python3 installed on Linux, run the program with Tests/BibleBooksCodesTests.py (once you have made the program file "executable").
#               (Alternatively, try: python3 Tests/BibleBooksCodesTests.py)
#       Note that although the --help switch works, most of the other displayed options are included for compatibility reasons only, and do not function correctly.
